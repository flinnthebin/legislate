/home/chris/.documents/legislate/node_modules/react-native-safe-area-context/android/build.gradle:103: Warning: A newer version of org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib than 1.6.20 is available: 1.7.10 [GradleDependency]
    implementation "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib:$kotlin_version"
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDependency":
   This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using
   is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there
   are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
   However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is
   available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

/home/chris/.documents/legislate/node_modules/react-native-safe-area-context/android/build.gradle:102: Warning: Avoid using + in version numbers; can lead to unpredictable and unrepeatable builds (com.facebook.react:react-native:+) [GradleDynamicVersion]
    implementation 'com.facebook.react:react-native:+'
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDynamicVersion":
   Using + in dependencies lets you automatically pick up the latest available
   version rather than a specific, named version. However, this is not
   recommended; your builds are not repeatable; you may have tested with a
   slightly different version than what the build server used. (Using a
   dynamic version as the major version number is more problematic than using
   it in the minor version position.)
