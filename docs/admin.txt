The concerns about governance and financial management of the Jervis Bay Territory Aboriginal Land Council had been ongoing for a number of years. These concerns were raised both internally, by members of the Council, and externally, by government agencies and other stakeholders.

In 2015, the Australian Government took action to address these concerns by placing the Council under special administration. This was a significant intervention, which involved suspending the existing Council and appointing an external administrator to take over the management of the Council's affairs.

The special administration lasted for two years and was aimed at improving the financial and governance arrangements of the Council. During this period, the administrator undertook a number of significant reforms, including reviewing the Council's governance arrangements and financial management practices, and implementing new policies and procedures to improve transparency and accountability.

The special administrator also worked closely with the Council to address outstanding debts and to develop a new strategic plan for the Council's future. This plan focused on improving the Council's ability to manage its assets, including its land holdings and financial resources, and on better engaging with the Wreck Bay community to ensure that their interests were being represented.

Overall, the special administration was seen as a necessary step to address the ongoing concerns about the governance and financial management of the Council. While there were some initial concerns about the intervention, particularly around the loss of autonomy for the Council, most stakeholders agreed that it was necessary to ensure the long-term sustainability of the Council and its ability to represent the interests of the Wreck Bay community.
