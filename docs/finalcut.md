## Jervis Bay

<!-- geomap pan into Jervis Bay -->

Jervis Bay Territory is a Federal territory on the South Coast of New South Wales, a State which holds approximately 1/3 of Australian citizens.
Unlike the Northern Territory (NT) and Australian Capital Territory (ACT) which have their own Legislative Assemblies, Jervis Bay Territory is
administered directly by the Federal Government.

Jervis Bay is home to the Wreck Bay community, an indigenous community who have occupied the territory which forms part of the larger Yuin nation.
Evidence of the occupation of the region by the community is dated as far back as the last ice age. Under the original legislation of the Aboriginal
Land Grant (Jervis Bay Territory) Act 1986, the community is charged with forming a council of three members of equal authority who are responsible
for the management of the council affairs. Historically a chairperson and deputy chairperson have been internally selected from these three members.
The council are empowered to appoint an executive committee to assist with the day-to-day management and administration of the council's affairs, development
of policy and ensuring legal compliance. The executive committee can grow and shrink as required, as none of these positions are paid. Expenses of
members of the council and the executive committee can be approved by the Minister for Indigenous Australians.

The Aboriginal Land Grant (Jervis Bay Territory) Amendment (Strengthening Land and Governance Provisions) Bill 2022 aims to address four key areas in the Land Grant Act. Firstly, it aims to facilitate home ownership style leases by exempting certain leases granted by the Council (for a term of 40 years or more) from the application of the RTA. This will enable registered members to voluntarily enter into home ownership style leases with the Council. Secondly, the bill seeks to strengthen local decision-making by increasing the payment amount at which the Council is required to seek approval from the Minister before entering into a contract, from $100,000 to $1 million. Thirdly, the bill intends to improve the Council's governance and corporate operations by empowering the executive committee, introducing a fit and proper person test for executive members and prospective executive members, establishing a CEO position, and conferring additional powers and responsibilities to the Registrar, among other changes. Lastly, the bill aims to amend or remove outdated or unclear provisions, such as changing the name of the Land Grant Act, repealing subsection 9A(2) of the Land Grant Act, updating the wording in relation to the term "physical or mental incapacity" of executive members, and more.

In 2015 the Federal Government placed the council under a 2 year special administration period to address some concerns regarding its governance and financial
management. This bill forms part of a larger effort by the Government to improve the arrangements of this governance and financial managment. In order to
facilitate this improvement, the legislation calls for a number of provisions. Most notably these include 'fit and proper persons tests' for members of the council, including
but not limited to criminal history and current bankruptcy checks.

The bill proposes the position of a paid CEO, who will be responsible for the day-to-day administration of the council, entering into contracts and
employing staff. The CEO will be empowered to delegate functions they deem necessary to employees of the council. The executive committee of the council may
give the CEO written directions, but it is important to note that these written directions are not considered a legislative instrument and the CEO can choose
to follow them at their own discretion. The CEO will be included under the council's 'accountable authority' under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013. Currently, the council's accountability authority under the PGPA Act consists only of the executive committee.

The bill also calls for a vast expansion of the powers of the Registrar. In the original Act, the role of the Registrar was to register members of the community who were eligible to vote in Council elections, grant leases and licenses over land, manage the Jervis Bay Territory Trust account and facilitate
dispute resolution. However, the bill notes that "the registrar does not currently have a clear role and purpose". The registrar will have the power to investigate, upon request from the Minister, CEO or an executive committee member; whether a prospective or current member of the executive committee is a
'fit and proper person'. The registrar is also empowered to act as the administrator of the council if all executive members are removed, as an 'accountable authority' under the PGPA Act in an 'interim period', if required.

The bill provides exemption for leases granted by the council for a term in excess of 40 years or more from the application of the Residential Tenancies Act 1997.
This will help facilitate registered member(s) of the community, non-registered members of the community who have express written consent of the minister, and registered members who are using the lease for the benefit of community members to enter into voluntary, home ownership style leases with the council.

It is important to acknowledge and respect the diversity and complexity of Indigenous cultures and communities across Australia. The proposed amendments represent an important step towards ensuring that appropriate checks and balances are in place to ensure transparency and accountability in the governance process, and that the Wreck Bay community's interests are represented and protected.
