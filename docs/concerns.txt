One issue is that the selection of executive members has been criticized for lacking transparency and accountability. In some cases, executive members have been appointed without a proper nomination process or without consulting with the wider community. This has led to allegations of nepotism and favoritism in the selection of executive members.

Another concern is the conduct of some executive members, with allegations of misuse of funds and conflicts of interest. For example, there have been allegations that some executive members have used their position to award contracts to family members or associates, or to receive personal benefits from the Council.

These concerns have led to calls for reform of the governance arrangements of the Council, including the establishment of a more transparent and accountable selection process for executive members, and the implementation of stronger checks and balances to prevent conflicts of interest and misuse of funds.

The Aboriginal Land Grant (Jervis Bay Territory) Amendment (Strengthening Land and Governance Provisions) Bill 2022 is one such reform measure. The proposed amendments aim to strengthen the requirements for executive members to be "fit and proper persons" to hold office, and to provide for the removal of executive members who do not comply with their obligations or are found to be unfit for office. The establishment of a CEO position is also intended to provide greater oversight and management of the Council's operations.

Overall, the ongoing concerns about the governance arrangements of the Council highlight the importance of ensuring that Indigenous communities have a say in the management of their land and assets, and that appropriate checks and balances are in place to ensure transparency and accountability in the governance process.
